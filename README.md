# Radio Transmitter

This is a simple radio transmitter project. You can try the simulation files with ``LTspice`` and you can check the demo video too. Whit this circuit can you test an old radio. Let's try it, have a fun!


## How it works

The LTspice simulation file contains this circuit. The **first transistor stage** is a mixer and oscillator, the **second** is a small and simple amplifier stage. In first stage I use an AF transformer from an old radio (NEYWA 402) for the audio signal, but you can use other type too. Not critical.

FFT signal is here, it works on ~730kHz (so on Medium wave):
